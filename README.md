#Stockr
##An app for exploring correlations

This app allows you compare information from several different sources with stock market trends. Using multiple APIs and D3.js to visualize information from these APIs, users can explore whether there is a correlation between a NYSE stock's change in value and other parameters they pick, like the weather in New York or what was said in [Congress](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/Capitol-Words/) that day. 

Stockr is a work in progress, but check back soon for more functionality and suggestions on how to use it.
